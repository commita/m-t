This is the first post for Monospaced Thoughts, yet another technology blog.
~
On the tech matter: it is setup using the, rather simple but so hacker-ish,
[toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto) blog "engine". It uses git to commit new posts.
As of now, I'm writing this on my local vim and, literally, am going to commit
it to the blog repository. (*geek chills*)

Back to the blog, its intents are not to try to conquer the real, cold and cruel
world, but the Little Prince's moon.

It is, in short, meant to share content and knowledge.

Accept then, or not, its little humble welcome.
