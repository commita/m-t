Sadly, we're saying good bye to the awesome
[toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto) blog engine and we are moving to, the
more awesome still, [Octopress](http://octopress.org). The reason is that while
_toto_ is simple and efficient, it takes too much time to get some things done,
like syntax highlighting of source code and besides I eventually get it done
writing some really simple and elegant stuff (using Rack middlewares and
pygments), also learning many things in the process, I think I didn't actually
want to spend my time doing that, because I'd rather spend it writing actual
content (which is much more difficult for us).

Octopress has also some third party plugins (sidebar is filled with those) and
the most important is possibility to create our own custom plugins, so we
decided to give it a try.

Of course this layout isn't the original, but we'll eventually get it ported to
Octopress, or even come up with something new. But for now it is what it is.

Nonetheless, nothing better than to start fresh with a fresh new year. Happy
new year to everyone!
