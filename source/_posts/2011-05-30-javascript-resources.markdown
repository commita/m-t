Quick post. Just a (loosely gathered) compilation of JavaScript resources
(framework collections, libraries, documentation, etc) that I ran into this
weekend.

## First Things First

<font color="red">Beware of w3schools</font>. Here's a very good explanation at [w3fools.com](http://w3fools.com).

## The Paperwork

* ECMAScript (ECMA-262) [language specification](http://www.ecmascript.org/)

## JavaScript References

* The excellent Mozilla's MDC (Mozilla Developer Center, or "devmo") [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference)
* javascriptkit's [JavaScript Reference](http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/index.shtml)

## Framework Collections

* [EveryJS](http://www.everyjs.com) is a community maintened "index of modern
  JavaScript".
* [MicroJS](http://microjs.com) is also a list of frameworks but targets
  micro-frameworks (frameworks that would fit in 5 kbytes or less and serve a
  single purpose).

## Best Practices
